# What I Learned
- How to leverage SASS to organize code, using multiple files & importing them to a single 'styles.scss' using '@forward'.
- How to use Typescript to dynamically render a web-application that is responsive to user requests (DOM manipulation).
- How to use local storage to save user's sessions, creating the logic to use it whenever the user's browser supports it.
- How to create an application that involves nested objects (i.e A 'Project' object that contains an array of 'Todos').
- How to use Moments JS and Date-fns to format dates and check when a date is between two other dates.
- How to use Webpack 5 to resolve all files into a single bundle.js file.
- How to use pubSub to publish events with data (pubSub.publish).
- How to use pubSub to listen to events and run functions with the data (pubSub.subscribe).
